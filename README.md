# CIV1498_Project2_House Price Prediction in Toronto

In this project, we are going to conduct a comperhensive analyze of the housing prices in Toronto and build a machine learning model for price prediction. This project is very helpful for the real estate market and our model can be used for both house sellers and house buyers.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the real estate market has experienced many fluctuations. House prices went down during the shutdowns and went up after re-openings. All of these factors make the prediction of house prices so complicated and impossible. Proper and justified prices of properties can bring a lot of transparency and trust back to the real estate industry, which is very important for most consumers. Despite the vast amount of data, we do not have accurate measures of house prices. Therefore, this project tries to contribute to the estimate of house prices based on different features of the properties and characteristics of each neighborhood In Toronto.

Many questions such as how different areas compare to each other in terms of value, price, demographic distribution remained unanswered.

Related questions:
- Sources and means to obtain the housing dataset
- Feature engineer new predictors using different sources
- Key insights from current housing market
- ML model selection
- Hyperparameter optimization

Projectâ€™s key takeaways:
- Efficient web scraping
- Self built dataset and feature engineering
- Geographical data visualization
- Standardizing and power transforming the data
- Handling missing data
- Developing and creating ML models for house price prediction

Datasets:

- Handcrafted housing dataset (time horizon - 1 year)
- Geographical data of GTA neighbourhoods
- Neighbourhood profiles
- Geographical data of Toronto subway lines/stations
